## 1. Project Scope  
We are building a **network visualization tool** that shows **real-time interaction** between network devices. This project is intentionally wild, visually stunning, and infused with **retro aesthetics**—think neon grids, wireframes, terminal green-on-black UI, and raw data pulses.

---

## 2. Vision Statement  
Create the most badass network tool imaginable—functional, real-time, stylish, and unique.

---

## 3. Key Objectives  
- Real-time visualization of packet flow and device interactions  
- Interactive and intuitive UI with retro-inspired design  
- Scalable to various network sizes and topologies  
- Easy integration with modern and legacy network protocols  
- High performance with minimal latency

---

## 4. Core Features  
- Real-time network map with device nodes and connections  
- Packet tracing with animated flow lines (packets visualized as moving circles)  
- Agar.io-style host representation with scaled sizes based on traffic volume  
- Time-travel mode (rewind/fast-forward traffic visualization)  
- Device metadata on hover  
- Filtering by protocol, device type, or IP range  
- Dark mode with CRT-inspired themes

## 5. Tech Stack  

### Backend  
- **Language:** Go  
- **Real-Time Communication:** WebSockets (Gorilla or native)  
- **Packet Capture:** libpcap, tshark, or custom ingestors  
- **Architecture:** Event-driven pub/sub for real-time updates

### Frontend  
- **Framework:** React  
- **Rendering Engine:** PixiJS (or @pixi/react)  
- **State Management:** Zustand or Jotai  
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS  
- **Visual Enhancements:** CRT shaders, glow effects, animated trails

### Supporting Tools  
- Framer Motion (for UI transitions)  
- Stats.js (for FPS/performance)  
- InfluxDB or TimescaleDB (for optional time-series data)

---

## 6. Design Guidelines  
- Retro sci-fi aesthetic (80s cyberpunk, neon vibes)  
- Smooth game-style animations  
- High contrast and dark terminal-like elements  
- CRT overlays, scanlines, noise effects  
- Component-based UI for modularity
